OpenNLP and Solr Examples
===========================

The Apache OpenNLP library contains several components, enabling one to build a full natural language processing pipeline.  These components include:
*	Sentence Splitting
*	Tokenization
*	Part of Speech tagging
*	Named entity recognition
*	Chunker
*	Parser 
	

Added the code to build custom model file and use it to identify color  

There is Sample Solr Code and Custom Query Parser Example as well.
